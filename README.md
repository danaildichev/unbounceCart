It's an easy-to-use shopping cart UI that can send your customers to a checkout page.

- Cart UI is unobtrusive and easily accessible
- Pleasantly animated additions and product removals
- Supports coupon codes
- Supports URL parameter retention
- Handles currency formatting in USD by default
- Has a built-in debug mode

I built this shopping cart when I was working for a publishing company. It needed to run on landing pages built with Unbounce's WYSIWYG so we could integrate them into a checkout flow using Checkout Champ as the payment processor. Unbounce and Checkout Champ are popular service providers in the marketing world. If that's you then there's a good chance this shopping cart should work for you with very little configuration. You'll need to replace the example content with your own product names, descriptions, and prices. The cart can be very easily adapted to work for a different payment processor.
